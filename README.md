# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This is my mobile-first, responsive webpage design. So far I have just added the necessary metas and links in the header to the Bootstrap CDN, the same navigation bar we used in class, and created links between the three HTML files used to display our three pages.


## Getting used to markdown

* Created the appropriate links to Bootstrap and to identify the viewport
* Copypasta'd the navigation bar and removed the drop-down list
* Created links between the three web pages we need to display

## Commit Early and Often

* Trying to commit in baby steps until told to do otherwise. I'm also getting sleepy.
