# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This assignment is to create a responsive website, with three pages. About me, Contact, and Portfolio. 

### Minimum Requirements Met

* Functional, deployed application.

* GitHub repository with README describing the project.

* Navbar is consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page contains links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links work.

* Uses semantic html.

* Each page has valid and correct HTML. (used a validation service)

* Contains most of my personalized information - but no image of me yet

* SOMEWHAT DECENTLY uses Bootstrap to display the information! :D


### Bonus

* Used Bootstrap to create a sticky footer. I changed the opacity to .2 so that it was clear and more text could be shown behind it.
* Committed to GitHub more than before!
